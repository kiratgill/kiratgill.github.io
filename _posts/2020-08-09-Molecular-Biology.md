# Classical Molecular Biology:

Molecular Evolution is concerned with the evolution of genes which codes Proteins which then changes their shape and consequentially their function thus Behavior.


<a id="org0b09eeb"></a>

## Proteins

-   **Genes** &#x2013;> *Specify Proteins*.
    DNA codes for the Amino Acids, different Amino Acids plugged together creates a protein.
    **More thoroughly (the coding from left to right)**:
    Sequence of DNA &#x2013;> Sequence of RNA &#x2013;> Sequence of Amino Acids &#x2013;> Proteins &#x2013;> Shape of Proteins &#x2013;> Function of Proteins.
    *Different Proteins differ in shape and functionality of Proteins is defines Structurally.* `Different Effector Protiens fits into other like key and lock.`
    **Shape of Protein interact information with something else which modifies its shape or compliment it.**

-   Functions:
    Almost all of the occurring enzymes in nature are proteins.
    Proteins sends and receive signals.
    Proteins holds all the structure in a body together.

-   There are three base pairs (*nucleotide*) in each gene or DNA segment which codes for one proteins.


<a id="orgc30edd3"></a>

## Amino Acids

-   There are almost 20 most commonly occurring Amino Acids in body. Each share different relationship with water. Some are Hydrophilic while other Hydrophobic.
    The relationship with water creates different strings of attached Amino Acids thus resulting protein differ in shape.


<a id="org1254d8f"></a>

## Central Dogma of Life

The flow of life is from DNA &#x2013;> RNA &#x2013;> Proteins.
DNA dictates everything happening in the body. **But it is not.**

-   **Retro Viruses violates this dogma**:
    Have enzymes which turns RNA to DNA (*viral information*), the flow of information is reversed here (*From RNA to DNA*).


<a id="org81efec6"></a>

## Classical Micro-Mutations of DNA (Mutation in coding part)

**Point Mutations**: if single base pair is changed.
    If the change occur in middle nucleotide then there is zero consequence because each Amino Acid can be coded in different ways.
    If the base pairs of the sides gets altered then there might be a minor consequence.
    If the change in pairs produce a different Amino Acid then a major consequence occurs.

Benzodiazepiens a collective family of chemicals which suppress anxiety. Each base pair can roughly code 2-3 same proteins but they differ in effectiveness and this creates variability in stress management in individuals depending upon which one is coded the most.

**Insertion Mutations**: if there is some excess of information gets coded in the expression of Amino Acid.
    Entire sequence is shifted, different protein is formed.
    Major Consequences.

**Deletion Mutations**: if there is some information is missing while coding for a Amino Acids because of a missing Base pair.
    Entire sequence is shifted like Insertion Mutations.
    Major Consequences.


<a id="org3243ed0"></a>

## Micro Evolution

Micro Mutations makes it possible.
A single base pair changes a protein&rsquo;s efficacy. Which could have major of minor consequence.
  Can render protein non-functional by wiping out enzyme. Effects the reproductive success.
  Can reduce its effectiveness.
If change makes an individual more adaptive then that individual will be selected naturally.

This adhere to the modal of **Gradualism** (*gradual change over time*).
Gradualism allow trace back of evolution of genes, by tracing back single base pair changes to the Amino Acid. It provides insight in selection history.

Statistically 2/3 of mutations do not have any effects, 1/3 could differ in their effectiveness. (64 total coding paths some are signals, so only remains about 60 ways. and each Amino Acid can be coded in three different combination of pairs.)


<a id="org82cbc6a"></a>

### Stable/Negative Selection

If 99% of mutations yields the same Amino Acid (**Inconsequential**). These genes are those whose function was kept intact throughout evolution. Any changes to these will be disastrous.


<a id="org8836f3c"></a>

### Positive/Consequential Selection

If 99% of the mutation yields different Amino Acid (**Consequential**). These genes were strongly selected for their adaptability and it is not a random process.


<a id="orged71e7e"></a>

# Humans and Chimps DNA

The fact that human share 98% DNA with chimps and 100% with twin, 50% with full sibling, 25% half sibling, 12.5% with cousins.

-   Humans and chimps.
    Humans and Chimps have 98% of similar genes coding for the same things.

-   Humans with humans
    Siblings share 50% of the same version of the same gene.


<a id="org99c9dba"></a>

# Evolution Model

-   **Gradual Model**: Every little bit of competition matters and evolution is gradual process.
-   **Punctuated Equilibrium Model**: First build after studying evolution of fossils.

        |           |

        |
        +------------------------
    
    *X - axis represent time.*
    *Y - axis represent the evolution of some specie.*
    
    Most of the changes are not consequential to trigger evolution (stasis). 1% (adaptability, mutation, optimization etc.) do not make any significant effect of evolution. When change occur it is rapid.
    
    -   **Criticism**:
        One of the person who proposed this model **GOULD** (Other one was **ELDERICH** an Evolutionary biologist) was a paleontologist, who study generation of species and what account rapid for him was in fact a time span of 100,000 years. Paleontologist are not biologist.
        Fossils do not tell you about the behavior, organs evolution of the animals, Paleontologist only study shape (*Morphology*).
        Non existence of the molecular model which support these findings. (**But now supports it**).

# Support for the punctuated equilibrium in the Molecular Biology

-   DNA base pairs which code for Amino Acids are not continuous. thus coding is not continuous.

<a id="orgc36a5b8"></a>

## Splicing Enzymes (RNA)

-   These Enzymes joins the Exon past to create required protein (gene sequence) from the given amino acid sequence. So, different proteins can be formed from the same sequence depending upon the function of the enzymes. Splicing enzymes cut away the parts of the introns.

        A single Functional gene.

<a id="orgc78ddd1"></a>

## Modularity of Genes

-   Depending upon the function of the **Splicing Enzymes** can be formed.
    **Degrative Enzymes** degrade part of the sequence to produce another expression of gene.

*Above are the 3 combination of all the 7 combination of 3 genes.*

Degrative enzymes and Splicing enzymes together creates tissue-specific expression of gene. In different part of the gene different proteins are formed as a function of the splicing agents.


<a id="org92a6953"></a>

## Non Coding DNA

Genes have spaces in between them and almost 95% of the DNA do not code for Amino Acids but acts as the activation switch for the genes, so, they regulate the genes in DNA.

                  Instruct Gene Activation Promoter/Represson Genes


<a id="orgf8ef607"></a>

## Transcription Factor

Owning to their biology Promoter (itself being a protein) have a dedicated shape which when combined with the complementary protein (which locks with it) activate the downstream gene.

-   A single gene can have multiple transcription factors and a single transcription factor can activate multiple genes. This creates a network of gene expression.

                      Instruct Gene Activation Promoter/Represson Genes
    
    The **Transcription Factors** are provided by the environment, as a result the environment determine the gene activation.
-   **Environment:** Anything external to the DNA, Could be the inside of the cell, inside of body, outside of body.


<a id="org23f4097"></a>

# Structural Access to DNA

-   DNA is surrounded by **Chromatin** which stabilize it. To access DNA then a transcription factor needs to go through the chromatin. So chromatin defines (**Structural access**) which factor have access to DNA and which one do not.
    
    A gene in the DNA can be permanently silenced (**Methlatation**) by changing Chromatin to inhibit the access to gene.
    This is called **Epigenetics** regulation of access to DNA sequence a change in phenotype without a change to genotype. Changes do not involve the underlying DNA but effects how the gene is read.


<a id="orgf80bfbe"></a>

# Macro-Mutations

Changes is Regulatory part of the DNA cause Macro-Mutations whereas mutations in coding part causes Micro-Mutations.
So, much of the significant evolutionary changes are brought by Macro-Mutations.


<a id="orgf1774e6"></a>

## Mutation in Splicing Enzymes:

If splicing agents splice differently than usual due to the mutation in the gene producing them, they create new proteins out of gene sequence. Since the enzymes are genes and there is a gene making (Splicing) exons and introns network which require splicing enzymes themselves and so on thus leading to **Recursive Regulation.**


<a id="orgdda273d"></a>

## Mutation is Regulatory part

Change in regulatory part of DNA causes the genes to activate under different conditions specified by regulation part. They change the *IF-THEN* behavior of gene.
**if** this part is selected **then** produce that gene sequence. The product of these mutation is **the creation of new network.**


<a id="org2082c68"></a>

### Mutation in Promoter:

If a promoter is changed that produce new promoter which interact with a different transcription factor, as a result a that same transcription factor can create new effects specified by promoter.
A sequence has multiple copies of the same promoter at different places on DNA. So, produced network is modified.


<a id="org4e58259"></a>

### Mutation in Transcription Factor:

The change in the transcription factors. which specify the activation of different promoter on the DNA. thus leading to a complete different network than before for the same environmental signal.


<a id="orga23dd67"></a>

# Number of Coding/Regulatory Genes

Higher the Coding genes in a body, higher will be the number of Regulatory genes.
For 3 genes there are 7 combinations of proteins that can be produced, consequentially it requires 7 different transcription Factors to express all the possible combinations. (Exponential rise in transcription factors for single added gene.)


<a id="orgad2c758"></a>

# Mobility of Genes

**Transposable (*transposase enzyme*) Genetic Elements/Jumping Genes/Transposons**
Moving around of genes in a DNA.

First discovered in Plants. When plants are stressed they shuffle genes at random to try to come up with something new, from which they could benefit in the crisis *(Cellular stress response).*

In Animals, antibodies are created by splicing genes which creates antibodies and jumping these genes around. Ineducable tansposable events.
Trypanosome pathogen does juggling to evolve in its host body.
Shuffling at the time of making new neurons.

-   **Moving around Regulatory Elements**

-   **Moving around Coding Elements**
    Moving around exons. Copies of genes can be created and moved around, in a hope to relate to more genes.


<a id="org04ad3e7"></a>

## Steroids Working

Steroids hormones enter cell and binds to their receptor, the resulting construction has some specific shape which locks with the promoters. The part of the receptor which binds with the steroids is called **Hormone Binding Domain** and the part which binds with promoter is known as **DNA Binding Domain**.

If due to some transposable event the Harmon binding domain gets attached to different genes and it will trigger different behavior.


<a id="orgcd4a2db"></a>

# Copying of Genes

**Gene Duplication/ Copy Number Invariant**
Copy of a gene of whole stretch of genes in a body.

-   Backup: the copies of genes acts like backup for the mutated genes which do not function adequately.
-   Number of genes copies directly proportional to protein intake.
-   Experiment: The experiments can be conducted on the copy while preserving the critical functionality of the gene. One copy evolve while the other remains stable.
    Copies can provide intermediate state of evolution, where, over the time; different pieces gets formed and when combined in a effective way a new functionality is gained by the organisms.


<a id="orgd63e6a1"></a>

# Odds of successful combination

-   Damn minimal
    Most of the combinations are not benevolent for the host. Majority of combinations are dangerous to the body.
    So, most of the time there is no change happening so its stasis.
-   Evolution Bottleneck Selection
    When under an extreme condition the body forego the danger of gene manipulation and try to mutate a great number of genes to try to come up with a solution which could be the key to survival. At these time there is a Punctuated rapid change occurs.


<a id="orgb73a5af"></a>

# Micro and Macro-Evolution

Micro changes are usually about changing the function of a single gene, while, macro changes are about finding new genes, and their functionality context.


<a id="org10e5f86"></a>

# Fox Experiment

Taming fox for one trait comes with other traits like floppy ears, piebald coloration pattern.
Making wild animal domestic involves, selecting for Infantial traits. Which are traits which makes them act like babies.


<a id="org58196f3"></a>

# Gradualism and Punctuated Change

Change in evolution do not occur singularly. They are accompanied by other changes.
So, over the time there are multiple punctuated changes keeps on going and combined they look as if they are growing gradually on the population level.
